# Fuzzy Car (Deep Learning Project n°1)

## Overview

Our project covers various aspects around deep learning, including game development, obstacle detection (simple or complex with fuzzy variation), and a driving assistant feature. We've combined these elements into a unique game that assists players in making the best decisions regarding speed and road navigation based on obstacles and fuzzy logic in a three ways road plan perspective.

## Motivation

Our motivation stems from two main points. First, we aim to reduce traffic accidents by helping users make informed choices and preventing accidents based on driver health. Did you know that 25% of accidents are caused by speeding? This highlights the need for an AI system to prevent excessive acceleration. Additionally, 16% of accidents result from driver inattention, emphasizing the importance of car crash prevention and object detection. By addressing these two major causes, we can potentially reduce accidents by 41%.
